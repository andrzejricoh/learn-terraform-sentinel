# Learn Sentinel -Enforce a Policy

[**AN**] This is my own companion repository for the [Cost Estimation
tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/cost-estimation) on
HashiCorp Learn (uses Azure provider rather than AWS).

It contains an example Sentinel policy to restrict resource
provisioning that would increase costs by more than $100.
